                    I'm currently a first year student at SFU, enrolled within the
                    SFU-ZJU Dual Degree program. In this program, I first have to
                    study 3.5 years of Computing Science at SFU, then I fly over
                    to Zhejiang University in China to get a Master of Finance over
                    the course of 1.5 years.

                    Some of my hobbies include skiing, hiking, going to the gym, playing video
                    games, visiting animal cafes, and eating food.

                    If you get to know me well enough, you'll come to find that I'm a
                    pretty chill person that loves to crack jokes and just have a good time.
